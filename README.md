# Regret

I've been developing on an editor for my Android App recently, using Jetpack Compose, but Google doesn't implement a built-in undo/redo for developers.
Nice to come across this library [Regret](https://github.com/Muddz/Regret), it's awesome. But I have to change something to achieve what I need.
Then I used Kotlin to rewrite the part and added the ability to limit the length of the linked list.

**Regret** is an Android library for apps that wants to implement an undo/redo feature.
The library is simple to use and works with all primitive types and objects and is especially suitable for drawing, text and photo editing apps.
